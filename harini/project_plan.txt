AI Autonomous Vehicle and Robotics Project Plan

Information Gathered:
- User wants a project involving AI autonomous vehicle and robotics.
- Technologies: Python for backend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend.
- No existing files, so project will be created from scratch.

Plan:
1. Backend (Python):
   - Use Flask as a lightweight web framework to serve API endpoints and frontend files.
   - Implement a simple AI simulation for autonomous vehicle behavior (e.g., path planning, obstacle avoidance).
   - Implement basic robotics control logic simulation.
   - Provide API endpoints to get vehicle status, sensor data, and control commands.

2. Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):
   - Create a dashboard to visualize the autonomous vehicle and robot status.
   - Use JavaScript (possibly with a canvas or SVG) to simulate vehicle movement and sensor data visualization.
   - Provide controls to start/stop simulation and send commands.

3. Integration:
   - Frontend communicates with backend via REST API calls.
   - Backend runs the simulation and updates frontend with current state.

Dependent Files to be created:
- backend/app.py (Flask app with AI and robotics simulation)
- frontend/index.html (Dashboard UI)
- frontend/style.css (Styling)
- frontend/script.js (Frontend logic and API communication)

Followup Steps:
- Implement backend Flask app with simulation logic.
- Implement frontend dashboard.
- Test integration and simulation functionality.

Please confirm if I can proceed with this plan or provide any additional requirements.
